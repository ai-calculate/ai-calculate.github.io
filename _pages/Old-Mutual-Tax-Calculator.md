### Income Tax Brackets for 2024/2025

```

### How the Calculator Works for South Africa

### Benefits of Using the Calculator

* Helps estimate monthly tax deductions
* Supports financial planning
* Increases understanding of SARS deductions

## Tax Calculation in Namibia

### Overview of Namibian Tax Structure

Namibia also uses a progressive tax system managed by the Ministry of Finance. Personal income tax is based on a yearly tax table.

### Namibia Tax Brackets for 2024/2025

```plaintext
- Up to N$100,000: 0%
- N$100,001 – N$150,000: 18%

- N$350,001 – N$550,000: N$59,000 + 28% above N$350,000
- N$550,001 – N$850,000: N$115,000 + 30% above N$550,000
- N$850,001 – N$1,550,000: N$205,000 + 32% above N$850,000
- Above N$1,550,001: N$429,000 + 37% above N$1,550,000
```

### Tax Calculator Logic for Namibia

Once Namibia is selected, the calculator applies the relevant tax rate based on the input income. For instance, an income of N\$600,000 will be taxed partially at 30% for the amount above N\$550,000.

### Advantages for Namibians

## Tax Calculation in Zimbabwe

### Zimbabwe’s Tax Policy

Zimbabwe uses a USD-based progressive tax system, and includes a special AIDS Levy of 3% on the final tax payable.

### 2024/2025 Zimbabwe Tax Brackets

```plaintext
- Up to $1,200: 0%
- $1,201 – $3,600: 20%
